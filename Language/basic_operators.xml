SELECT selects data FROM a database.
SELECT * selects all the columns.
DISTINCT returns unique values in a column.
WHERE filters results based on a condition.
Comparison operators: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
LIKE operator searches for a specific pattern.
BETWEEN operator matches values in a range.
ORDER BY sorts data (ascending/descending).

SELECT - choosing the items needed from the database
FROM - particular place (column) 
WHERE - setting a condition to choose items which correspond to the condition
* - selecting all the columns 
; - symbol indicating the end of the inquiry 

example: 
SELECT column1, column2, column3 
FROM name-of-the-table; 
or: 
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM name-of-the-table WHERE id > 6;
or: 
SELECT * 
FROM name-of-the-table 
WHERE name LIKE 'T%'; # T - indicates the first letter of the name of the variable we want to retrive.
The % can be used in different ways:
A% matches values that begin with letter 'A'.
%z matches values that end with 'z'.
%com% matches values that have 'com' in them


= equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

  
The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. The range must be separated by an AND keyword.
For example, this query filters the result to only include shows between the years 2020 and 2025 (inclusive):
SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE year
BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025;


The ORDER BY statement sorts rows of data in ascending or descending order. By default, this command sorts the data in ascending order.
So how does it work? Letâ€™s see it in action:
SELECT name, genre, stream, year
FROM shows
ORDER BY year;
